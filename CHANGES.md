While the Ring spec has always [required](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/SPEC.md#request-method) a keyword value for `:request-method` (e.g. `:get`), previously, Aleph would also accept string methods (e.g. `"GET"`). This means that `wrap-validation` may cause HTTP requests to fail on previously valid input. This is fixed since 0.9.0.
