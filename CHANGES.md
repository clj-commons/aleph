While the Ring spec has always [required](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/SPEC.md#request-method) a keyword value for `:request-method` (e.g. `:get`), previously, Aleph would also accept string methods (e.g. `"GET"`). This means that `wrap-validation` may cause HTTP requests to fail on previously valid input. This is fixed since 0.9.0.

Contributions by Arnaud Geiser, Ertuğrul Çetin, Jeroen van Dijk, David Ongaro, 
Matthew Davidson, and Moritz Heidkamp.
