  "Returns a [Dirigiste](https://github.com/clj-commons/dirigiste) object pool, which can be interacted
   with via `acquire`, `release`, and `dispose`.

   Param key          | Description
   | ---              | ---
   | `generate`       | a single-arg funcion which takes a key, and returns an object which should be non-equal to any other generated object |
   | `destroy`        | an optional two-arg function which takes a key and object, and releases any associated resources |
   | `stats-callback` | a function which will be invoked every `control-period` with a map of keys onto associated statistics |
   | `max-queue-size` | the maximum number of pending acquires per key that are allowed before `acquire` will start to throw a `java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException`.
   | `sample-period`  | the interval, in milliseconds, between sampling the state of the pool for resizing and gathering statistics, defaults to `10`.
   | `control-period` | the interval, in milliseconds, between use of the controller to adjust the size of the pool, defaults to `10000`.
   | `controller`     | a Dirigiste controller that is used to gide the pool's size."
