(defn start-server
  "Starts an HTTP server using the provided Ring `handler`.  Returns a server object which can be stopped
   via `java.io.Closeable.close()`, and whose port can be discovered with `aleph.netty/port`.


   |:---------|:-------------
   | `port` | the port the server will bind to.  If `0`, the server will bind to a random port.
   | `socket-address` |  a `java.net.SocketAddress` specifying both the port and interface to bind to.
   | `bootstrap-transform` | a function that takes an `io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap` object, which represents the server, and modifies it.
   | `ssl-context` | an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object if an SSL connection is desired |
   | `manual-ssl?` | set to `true` to indicate that SSL is active, but the caller is managing it (this implies `:ssl-context` is nil). For example, this can be used if you want to use configure SNI (perhaps in `:pipeline-transform`) to select the SSL context based on the client's indicated host name. |
   | `pipeline-transform` | a function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents a connection, and modifies it.
   | `executor` | a `java.util.concurrent.Executor` which is used to handle individual requests.  To avoid this indirection you may specify `:none`, but in this case extreme care must be taken to avoid blocking operations on the handler's thread.
   | `shutdown-executor?` | if `true`, the executor will be shut down when `.close()` is called on the server, defaults to `true`.
   | `request-buffer-size` | the maximum body size, in bytes, which the server will allow to accumulate before invoking the handler, defaults to `16384`.  This does *not* represent the maximum size request the server can handle (which is unbounded), and is only a means of maximizing performance.
   | `raw-stream?` | if `true`, bodies of requests will not be buffered at all, and will be represented as Manifold streams of `io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf` objects rather than as an `InputStream`.  This will minimize copying, but means that care must be taken with Netty's buffer reference counting.  Only recommended for advanced users.
   | `rejected-handler` | a spillover request-handler which is invoked when the executor's queue is full, and the request cannot be processed.  Defaults to a `503` response.
   | `max-initial-line-length` | the maximum characters that can be in the initial line of the request, defaults to `8192`
   | `max-header-size` | the maximum characters that can be in a single header entry of a request, defaults to `8192`
   | `max-chunk-size` | the maximum characters that can be in a single chunk of a streamed request, defaults to `16384`
   | `epoll?` | if `true`, uses `epoll` when available, defaults to `false`
   | `compression?` | when `true` enables http compression, defaults to `false`
   | `compression-level` | optional compression level, `1` yields the fastest compression and `9` yields the best compression, defaults to `6`. When set, enables http content compression regardless of the `compression?` flag value
   | `idle-timeout` | when set, forces keep-alive connections to be closed after an idle time, in milliseconds"

   |:---|:---

   | `total-connections` | the maximum number of connections across all hosts
   | `target-utilization` | the target utilization of connections per host, within `[0,1]`, defaults to `0.9`
   | `stats-callback` | an optional callback which is invoked with a map of hosts onto usage statistics every ten seconds
   | `max-queue-size` | the maximum number of pending acquires from the pool that are allowed before `acquire` will start to throw a `java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException`, defaults to `65536`
   | `control-period` | the interval, in milliseconds, between use of the controller to adjust the size of the pool, defaults to `60000`
   | `dns-options` | an optional map with async DNS resolver settings, for more information check `aleph.netty/dns-resolver-group`. When set, ignores `name-resolver` setting from `connection-options` in favor of shared DNS resolver instance
   | `middleware` | a function to modify request before sending, defaults to `aleph.http.client-middleware/wrap-request`

   the `connection-options` are a map describing behavior across all connections:

   |:---|:---
   | `ssl-context` | an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object, only required if a custom context is required
   | `local-address` | an optional `java.net.SocketAddress` describing which local interface should be used
   | `bootstrap-transform` | a function that takes an `io.netty.bootstrap.Bootstrap` object and modifies it.
   | `pipeline-transform` | a function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents a connection, and modifies it.
   | `insecure?` | if `true`, ignores the certificate for any `https://` domains
   | `response-buffer-size` | the amount of the response, in bytes, that is buffered before the request returns, defaults to `65536`.  This does *not* represent the maximum size response that the client can handle (which is unbounded), and is only a means of maximizing performance.
   | `keep-alive?` | if `true`, attempts to reuse connections for multiple requests, defaults to `true`.
   | `idle-timeout` | when set, forces keep-alive connections to be closed after an idle time, in milliseconds.
   | `epoll?` | if `true`, uses `epoll` when available, defaults to `false`
   | `raw-stream?` | if `true`, bodies of responses will not be buffered at all, and represented as Manifold streams of `io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf` objects rather than as an `InputStream`.  This will minimize copying, but means that care must be taken with Netty's buffer reference counting.  Only recommended for advanced users.
   | `max-initial-line-length` | the maximum length of the initial line (e.g. HTTP/1.0 200 OK), defaults to `65536`
   | `max-header-size` | the maximum characters that can be in a single header entry of a response, defaults to `65536`
   | `max-chunk-size` | the maximum characters that can be in a single chunk of a streamed response, defaults to `65536`
   | `name-resolver` | specify the mechanism to resolve the address of the unresolved named address. When not set or equals to `:default`, JDK's built-in domain name lookup mechanism is used (blocking). Set to`:noop` not to resolve addresses or pass an instance of `io.netty.resolver.AddressResolverGroup` you need. Note, that if the appropriate connection-pool is created with dns-options shared DNS resolver would be used
   | `proxy-options` | a map to specify proxy settings. HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies are supported. Note, that when using proxy `connections-per-host` configuration is still applied to the target host disregarding tunneling settings. If you need to limit number of connections to the proxy itself use `total-connections` setting.
   | `response-executor` | optional `java.util.concurrent.Executor` that will execute response callbacks
   | `log-activity` | when set, logs all events on each channel (connection) with a log level given. Accepts either one of `:trace`, `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error` or an instance of `io.netty.handler.logging.LogLevel`. Note, that this setting *does not* enforce any changes to the logging configuration (default configuration is `INFO`, so you won't see any `DEBUG` or `TRACE` level messages, unless configured explicitly)

   Supported `proxy-options` are

   |:---|:---
   | `host` | host of the proxy server
   | `port` | an optional port to establish connection (defaults to 80 for http and 1080 for socks proxies)
   | `protocol` | one of `:http`, `:socks4` or `:socks5` (defaults to `:http`)
   | `user` | an optional auth username
   | `password` | an optional auth password
   | `http-headers` | (HTTP proxy only) an optional map to set additional HTTP headers when establishing connection to the proxy server
   | `tunnel?` | (HTTP proxy only) if `true`, sends HTTP CONNECT to the proxy and waits for the 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' response before sending any subsequent requests. Defaults to `false`. When using authorization or specifying additional headers uses tunneling disregarding this setting
   | `connection-timeout` | timeout in milliseconds for the tunnel become established, defaults to 60 seconds, setting is ignored when tunneling is not used."
