(defn start-server
  "Starts an HTTP server using the provided Ring `handler`.  Returns a server
   object which can be stopped via `java.io.Closeable.close()`, and whose port
   can be discovered with `aleph.netty/port` if not set.

   Defaults to HTTP/1.1-only.

   To enable HTTP/2, add `:http2` to the `http-versions` option. This requires you to also enable
   SSL via the `ssl-context` option. If you supply an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` instance, you
   have to set it up with ALPN support for HTTP/2.  See `aleph.netty/ssl-server-context` and
   `aleph.netty/application-protocol-config` for more details. If you supply an SSL options map
   without an `:application-protocol-config` key instead, the necessary ALPN configuration will be
   set up automatically. (You can also set `use-h2c?` to force HTTP/2 cleartext, but this is strongly
   discouraged.)

   | Param key                         | Description |
   | ---                               | --- |
   | `port`                            | The port the server will bind to. If `0`, the server will bind to a random port. |
   | `socket-address`                  | A `java.net.SocketAddress` specifying both the port and interface to bind to. |
   | `listen-socket`                   | A pre-bound server-socket as a `java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel` (NIO transport) or a `long` file descriptor (epoll and kqueue transports) for the server to use rather than opening and binding its own server-socket. It won't be closed by the server. Possibly obtained from `System/inheritedChannel`. |
   | `bootstrap-transform`             | A function that takes an `io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap` object, which represents the server, and modifies it. |
   | `http-versions`                   | An optional vector of allowable HTTP versions to negotiate via ALPN, in preference order. Defaults to `[:http1]`. |
   | `ssl-context`                     | An `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object or a map of SSL context options (see `aleph.netty/ssl-server-context` for more details) if an SSL connection is desired. When passing an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object, it must have an ALPN config matching the `http-versions` option (see `aleph.netty/ssl-server-context` and `aleph.netty/application-protocol-config`). If only HTTP/1.1 is desired, ALPN config is optional.
   | `manual-ssl?`                     | Set to `true` to indicate that SSL is active, but the caller is managing it (this implies `:ssl-context` is nil). For example, this can be used if you want to use configure SNI (usually via `:initial-pipeline-transform`) to select the SSL context based on the client's indicated host name. |
   | `executor`                        | A `java.util.concurrent.Executor` which is used to handle individual requests. To avoid this indirection you may specify `:none`, but in this case extreme care must be taken to avoid blocking operations on the handler's thread. |
   | `shutdown-executor?`              | If `true`, the executor will be shut down when `.close()` is called on the server, defaults to `true` . |
   | `request-buffer-size`             | The maximum body size, in bytes, that the server will allow to accumulate before placing on the body stream, defaults to `16384` . This does *not* represent the maximum size request the server can handle (which is unbounded), and is only a means of maximizing performance. |
   | `raw-stream?`                     | If `true`, bodies of requests will not be buffered at all, and will be represented as Manifold streams of `io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf` objects rather than as an `InputStream` . This will minimize copying, but means that care must be taken with Netty's buffer reference counting. Only recommended for advanced users. |
   | `rejected-handler`                | A spillover request-handler which is invoked when the executor's queue is full, and the request cannot be processed. Defaults to a `503` response. |
   | `max-request-body-size`           | The maximum length of the request body in bytes. If set, requires queuing up content until the request is finished, and thus delays processing. Unlimited by default. |
   | `validate-headers`                | If `true`, validates the headers when decoding the request, defaults to `false` |
   | `transport`                       | The transport to use, one of `:nio`, `:epoll`, `:kqueue` or `:io-uring` (defaults to `:nio` ) |
   | `compression?`                    | When `true`, enables HTTP body compression, defaults to `false` |
   | `compression-options`             | An optional Java array of `io.netty.handler.codec.compression.CompressionOptions`. If supplied, any codec options not passed in will be unavailable. Otherwise, uses default options for all available codecs. For Brotli/Zstd, be sure to guard your use with their `.isAvailable()` methods and add their deps to your classpath. |
   | `idle-timeout`                    | When set, connections are closed after not having performed any I/O operations for the given duration, in milliseconds. Defaults to `0` (infinite idle time). |
   | `continue-handler`                | Optional handler which is invoked when header sends \"Except: 100-continue\" header to test whether the request should be accepted or rejected. Handler should return `true`, `false`, ring responseo to be used as a reject response or deferred that yields one of those. |
   | `continue-executor`               | Optional `java.util.concurrent.Executor` which is used to handle requests passed to :continue-handler. To avoid this indirection you may specify `:none`, but in this case extreme care must be taken to avoid blocking operations on the handler's thread. |
   | `shutdown-timeout`                | Interval in seconds within which in-flight requests must be processed, defaults to 15 seconds. A value of `0` bypasses waiting entirely. |
   | `initial-pipeline-transform`      | A function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents the connection before any default handlers are installed (and thus, before HTTP version negotiation), and modifies it. |

   HTTP/1-specific options
   | Param key                         | Description |
   | ---                               | --- |
   | `allow-duplicate-content-lengths` | If `true`, allows duplicate `Content-Length` headers, defaults to true. Always true for HTTP/2 |
   | `max-initial-line-length`         | The maximum characters that can be in the initial line of the request, defaults to `8192` |
   | `max-header-size`                 | The maximum characters that can be in a single header entry of a request, defaults to `8192` |
   | `max-chunk-size`                  | The maximum characters that can be in a single chunk of a streamed request, defaults to `16384` |
   | `initial-buffer-size`             | The initial buffer size of characters when decoding the request, defaults to `128` |
   | `pipeline-transform`              | (DEPRECATED: Use `:http1-pipeline-transform` instead.) A function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents a connection, and modifies it. |
   | `http1-pipeline-transform`        | A function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents an HTTP/1 connection, and modifies it. Contains the user handler at \"request-handler\". |
   | `compression-level`               | (DEPRECATED: Use `compression-options` or leave unset.) Optional gzip/deflate compression level, `1` yields the fastest compression and `9` yields the best compression, defaults to `6`. Zstd or Brotli will also be enabled when available. Overridden by `compression-options`. |

   HTTP/2-specific options
   | Param key                         | Description |
   | ---                               | --- |
   | `use-h2c?`                        | If `true`, uses HTTP/2 for insecure servers. Has no effect on secure servers, and upgrades are not allowed. Defaults to false. |
   | `conn-go-away-handler`            | A connection-level cleanup handler for when a GOAWAY is received. Indicates the peer has, or soon will, close the TCP connection. Contains the last-processed stream ID.|
   | `stream-go-away-handler`          | A stream-level cleanup handler called for streams above the last-stream-id in a GOAWAY frame. Indicates the stream will not be processed. Called with the context and the Http2GoAwayFrame. |
   | `reset-stream-handler`            | A stream-level cleanup handler called for streams that have been sent RST_STREAM. Called with the context and the Http2ResetFrame. |
   | `http2-conn-pipeline-transform`   | A function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents an HTTP/2 connection, and modifies it. |
   | `http2-stream-pipeline-transform` | A function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents a single HTTP/2 stream, and modifies it. Contains the user handler at \"handler\". |

   To enable HTTP/2, add `:http2` to the `http-versions` option. If you supply an

   | `dns-options`                | an optional map with async DNS resolver settings, for more information check `aleph.netty/dns-resolver-group`. When set, ignores `name-resolver` setting from `connection-options` in favor of shared DNS resolver instance

   the `connection-options` are a map describing behavior across all connections:

   Param key                   | Description
   | ---                       | ---
   | `ssl-context`             | an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object or a map of SSL context options (see `aleph.netty/ssl-client-context` for more details), only required if a custom context is desired. When passing an `io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext` object, it must have an ALPN config matching the `http-versions` option (see `aleph.netty/ssl-client-context` and `aleph.netty/application-protocol-config`). If only HTTP/1.1 is desired, ALPN config is optional.
   | `ssl-endpoint-id-alg`     | the name of the algorithm to use for SSL endpoint identification (see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#endpoint-identification-algorithms), defaults to \"HTTPS\". Only used for HTTPS connections. Pass `nil` to disable endpoint identification.
   | `local-address`           | an optional `java.net.SocketAddress` describing which local interface should be used
   | `bootstrap-transform`     | a function that takes an `io.netty.bootstrap.Bootstrap` object and modifies it.
   | `pipeline-transform`      | a function that takes an `io.netty.channel.ChannelPipeline` object, which represents a connection, and modifies it.
   | `insecure?`               | if `true`, ignores the certificate for any `https://` domains
   | `response-buffer-size`    | the amount of the response, in bytes, that is buffered before the request returns, defaults to `65536`.  This does *not* represent the maximum size response that the client can handle (which is unbounded), and is only a means of maximizing performance.
   | `keep-alive?`             | if `true`, attempts to reuse connections for multiple requests, defaults to `true`.
   | `connect-timeout`         | timeout for a connection to be established, in milliseconds. Default determined by Netty, see `aleph.netty/default-connect-timeout`.
   | `idle-timeout`            | when set, forces keep-alive connections to be closed after an idle time, in milliseconds.
   | `transport`               | the transport to use, one of `:nio`, `:epoll`, `:kqueue` or `:io-uring` (defaults to `:nio`).
   | `raw-stream?`             | if `true`, bodies of responses will not be buffered at all, and represented as Manifold streams of `io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf` objects rather than as an `InputStream`.  This will minimize copying, but means that care must be taken with Netty's buffer reference counting.  Only recommended for advanced users.
   | `max-initial-line-length` | the maximum length of the initial line (e.g. HTTP/1.0 200 OK), defaults to `65536`
   | `max-header-size`         | the maximum characters that can be in a single header entry of a response, defaults to `65536`
   | `max-chunk-size`          | the maximum characters that can be in a single chunk of a streamed response, defaults to `65536`
   | `name-resolver`           | specify the mechanism to resolve the address of the unresolved named address. When not set or equals to `:default`, JDK's built-in domain name lookup mechanism is used (blocking). Set to`:noop` not to resolve addresses or pass an instance of `io.netty.resolver.AddressResolverGroup` you need. Note, that if the appropriate connection-pool is created with dns-options shared DNS resolver would be used
   | `proxy-options`           | a map to specify proxy settings. HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies are supported. Note, that when using proxy `connections-per-host` configuration is still applied to the target host disregarding tunneling settings. If you need to limit number of connections to the proxy itself use `total-connections` setting.
   | `response-executor`       | optional `java.util.concurrent.Executor` that will execute response callbacks
   | `log-activity`            | when set, logs all events on each channel (connection) with a log level given. Accepts one of `:trace`, `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error` or an instance of `io.netty.handler.logging.LogLevel`. Note, that this setting *does not* enforce any changes to the logging configuration (default configuration is `INFO`, so you won't see any `DEBUG` or `TRACE` level messages, unless configured explicitly)
   | `http-versions`           | an optional vector of allowable HTTP versions to negotiate via ALPN, in preference order. Defaults to `[:http1]`.

   HTTP/2-specific options
   | Param key                 | Description |
   | ---                       | --- |
   | `force-h2c?`              | an optional boolean indicating you wish to force the use of insecure HTTP/2 cleartext (h2c) for `http://` URLs. Not recommended, and unsupported by most servers in the wild. Only do this with infrastructure you control. Defaults to `false`.
   | `conn-go-away-handler`    | A connection-level cleanup handler for when a GOAWAY is received. Indicates the server has, or soon will, close the TCP connection. Contains the last-processed stream ID.|
   | `stream-go-away-handler`  | A stream-level cleanup handler called for streams above the last-stream-id in a GOAWAY frame. Indicates the stream will not be processed. Called with the context and the Http2GoAwayFrame. |
   | `reset-stream-handler`    | A stream-level cleanup handler called for streams that have been sent RST_STREAM. Called with the context and the Http2ResetFrame. |

   Supported `proxy-options` are

   | ---                  | ---
   | `host`               | host of the proxy server
   | `port`               | an optional port to establish connection (defaults to 80 for http and 1080 for socks proxies)
   | `protocol`           | one of `:http`, `:socks4` or `:socks5` (defaults to `:http`)
   | `user`               | an optional auth username
   | `password`           | an optional auth password
   | `http-headers`       | (HTTP proxy only) an optional map to set additional HTTP headers when establishing connection to the proxy server
   | `tunnel?`            | (HTTP proxy only) if `true`, sends HTTP CONNECT to the proxy and waits for the 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' response before sending any subsequent requests. Defaults to `false`. When using authorization or specifying additional headers uses tunneling disregarding this setting
   | `connection-timeout` | timeout in milliseconds for the tunnel become established, defaults to 60 seconds, setting is ignored when tunneling is not used."
