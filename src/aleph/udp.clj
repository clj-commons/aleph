(defn socket
  "Returns a deferred which yields a duplex stream that can be used to send and receive UDP datagrams.

   Param key               | Description
   | ---                   | ---
   | `port`                | the port at which UDP packets can be received.  If both this and `:socket-address` are undefined, packets can only be sent.
   | `socket-address`      | a `java.net.SocketAddress` specifying both the port and interface to bind to.
   | `broadcast?`          | if true, all UDP datagrams are broadcast.
   | `bootstrap-transform` | a function which takes the Netty `Bootstrap` object, and makes any desired changes before it's bound to a socket.
   | `raw-stream?`         | if true, the `:message` within each packet will be `io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf` objects rather than byte-arrays.  This will minimize copying, but means that care must be taken with Netty's buffer reference counting.  Only recommended for advanced users.
   | `epoll?`              | if `true`, uses `epoll`, defaults to `false`"
